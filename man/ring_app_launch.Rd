\usage{
ring_app_launch(launch.browser = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{launch.browser}{A logical value. 
If \code{FALSE}, a built-in browser will be launched automatically 
after the app is started. If \code{TRUE}, the system's default 
web browser is used instead. This argument only works for RStudio.
See details below.}
}
\description{
Run a Shiny-based application within the system's default 
web browser.
}
\details{
\code{launch.browser = FALSE} is not recommended, as the file renaming
does not work on the RStudio built-in browser when saving the data.

A workflow for the Shiny app can be found here:
\url{https://ropensci.github.io/MtreeRing/articles/app-MtreeRing.html}. 
Most steps are demonstrated with a gif
to make the workflow more understandable.

To stop the app, go to the R console and press the Escape key. 
You can also click the stop sign icon in the
upper right corner of the RStudio console.
